# üè≥Ô∏è Localization

We are using a tool called GitLocalize to manage translations for LifeStealZ. If you want to contribute to the translations, you'll need to sign in to [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com) with a GitHub Account. If you don't already have one, you can create one [here](https://github.com/signup).

After logging in, you can find the repo here:

LifeStealZ GitLocalize page
{% endembed %}

To start translating, follow these steps:

1. Select the language you would like to translate
2. Select the translation file
3. On the left should be the english version and on the right, you can enter the traslated strings
4. After you are done translating, create a Review Request by clicking the yellow button in the top

If the language, you want to translate to is not yet present in the list, please open a ticket on the [Discord](https://strassburger.org/discord)

### Discord Role

When you have contributed to translations, you can request a Translator role in the [Discord Server](https://strassburger.org/discord). With that you can talk and coordinate with other translators.
